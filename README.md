# ML_LinRegr2
This repository also uses Linear Regression but aims to exploit the cons of mentioned strategy. Once employed on a minute data set of real estate properties in a specific location, it can clearly be seen how lack of adequate info and fields can lead to not so realistic results!

Contrary to the Model I posted a few days [back](https://lnkd.in/dccye_FT).

This one uses only 2 independent variables; size and year to predict the cost of the property. Out of those 2, year was found to be an inappropriate estimator through tests like f-regression, p values, VIF values etc. Feel free to test out the model using the mini interface I created at the end of the Jupyter Notebook! Enter the size and year of manufacture of the house and get the estimates price of it right away!
